I have put some ascii u and t data onto our ftp area. The data
are from a composite of stations mainly singapore). I assume BarbN 
has the data also.  The only way to get the significant levels are present on 
the original daily tapes but not on these files.

(1) ftp sage.cgd.ucar.edu           [also could use ftp 128.117.56.10]
(2) log in as user anonymous
(3) use mail address for a password [actually anything could be used]
(4) cd pub/shea/mls
(5) set ascii
(6) get qbo_t            temperatures from a composite of stations
    get qbo_u            zonal winds  from a composite of stations
(7) logout

pressure levels are:

      data ipres /2000        ! 2000 is a code for the surface  
     *           ,1000,850,700,500,400,300,250,200,150,100
     *           ,  70, 50, 30, 20, 10/ 


example: id=station id;  x=type variable (2=temperature; 3=zonal wind)
         yr=year        mo=month
  id   x yr mo
489680 3 96 12   16   53   56    5  -48  -88 -125 -182 -241 -109  -33 -202  -53  163  172

read the data records using:

      read (iunit,
     *     "(i7,i2,2i3,17i5)") idqbo,itype,nyear,nmo
     *     ,(iwork(nl),nl=1,nlvl)

I will get back to u on this. I know that NCEP is using BUFR.
I think it is a terrible format but ....
